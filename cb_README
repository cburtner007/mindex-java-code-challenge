Overall pretty straight forward tasks. I have a spring project on the side, which helped, but I still
managed to get stuck a few times because I didn't annotate. Github Copilot helped here and there catch some 
of the dumb things (annotations), and helped with some of the tedious things (setting up unit tests).

I built up some unit tests for the Reporting Structure stuff, and then full integration tests for the
Reporting Structure (again) as well as the Compensation component. Didn't write tests for exception cases,
hopefully you'll find it in your heart to forgive me.

Really enjoyed working with Gradle over Maven. Maybe because STS seems to integrate with Gradle so well.
Maybe because at my current job we don't use Maven well. Not sure, but my experience with this challenge was
overall pleasant.
